	decorate with player objects

	/matchups?league=id
	return all as defined below

	* potential issue:
	if a player changes teams part way through
	the week we'll add him to the player array
	for that team, but when we decorate with player
	objects all the totals for the week won't
	match. We'll need to rely on the totals count
	and be careful to update the totals with the
	correct player's stats every game day

	Every game day:
	we loop through all players and add a random
	game to the log of the current week. We update
	the totals hash on that week's objects.

	We figure out what week it is and find those matchups
	then we loop through all players on each team and
	add that day's stats to the totals hash.

	If it's Sunday night/Monday morning we sum up all the
	totals, calculate wins/losses/ties, initialize the
	next week's matchup objects and add data and new
	matchup id to each team object found from the league
	endpoint.
